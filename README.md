# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

A Python-based visualization tool for common sorting algorithms. This project provides an interactive way to understand how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing their step-by-step execution. It provides real-time visualization of sorting algorithms
mainly Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for a full list of dependencies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application using:

```bash
python main.py
```

The visualization window will open, allowing you to:
1. Select a sorting algorithm
2. Adjust the array size and speed
3. Start/pause/reset the visualization
4. View the sorting process in real-time
